# Rockfall Prediction System

A smart solution developed under Smart India Hackathon (SIH) for predicting and mitigating rockfall hazards in hilly and mountainous regions. The system leverages IoT sensors, data analytics, and machine learning models to assess slope stability, detect early warning signs, and predict potential rockfall events to ensure safety and minimize damage.
