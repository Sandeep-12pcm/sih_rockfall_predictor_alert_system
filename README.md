# Rockfall Prediction System

A smart solution developed under Smart India Hackathon (SIH) for predicting and mitigating rockfall hazards in hilly and mountainous regions. The system leverages IoT sensors, data analytics, and machine learning models to assess slope stability, detect early warning signs, and predict potential rockfall events to ensure safety and minimize damage.

# üöÄ Features

- Real-time Monitoring ‚Äì Uses IoT sensors (accelerometers, vibration, weather, soil moisture, etc.) to collect live data.

- Machine Learning Prediction ‚Äì AI-based models trained on environmental and geological datasets for rockfall prediction.

- Alert System ‚Äì Early warning notifications via web dashboard, SMS, or app alerts.

- Data Visualization ‚Äì Interactive dashboard for slope conditions, historical data, and prediction results.

- Scalable Architecture ‚Äì Cloud-ready system that supports large-scale deployments.

- Customizable Account Settings
